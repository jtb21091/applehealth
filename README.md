#steps

Apple must have changed their XML output recently or there is something wrong with the export now. I am working on this again.

#1
download and export all apple health data from phone (top right in health app)

#2
open excel > data > get data (power query) (you may need power BI ~ just sign up for microsoft developer account) > get xml file into excel (you only need the records table)

#3
run the code in VS code (make sure you have correct path for excel file)
